# Snake Water Gun Game 🎮

## Introduction
My First Python Project
This is a simple game  **Python-based Snake Water Gun game** where the player competes against the computer.  
It's a fun command-line game inspired by the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" but with a twist:  
- **Snake** drinks Water 🐍💧  
- **Water** sinks Gun 💧🔫  
- **Gun** kills Snake 🔫🐍  

The game randomly selects the computer's choice and checks who wins each round.
